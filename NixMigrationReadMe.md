# Dear Replit user,

Welcome to your new, nix-powered repl!
We've migrated your repl over to our nix-based
infrastructure. Nix allows you to installed any
imaginable type of software into a repl, allowing
us to support an unbounded number of programming
languages. It is how we power all our repls now.
You can learn more at: https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/nix-on-replit

In order to migrate your repl to nix, we:

1. imported some files to support your programming language on the nix platform
2. turned on a flag that says the repl is a nix repl
3. restarted your repl

On the unlikely chance that our import process overwrites one of your files, we back
up each conflicting file to a file name with a .backup suffix.

Enjoy!

- the ReplIt Staff
